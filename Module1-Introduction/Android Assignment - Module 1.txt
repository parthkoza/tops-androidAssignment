Android Assignment

Module 1) Introduction

1)What is software
-->Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. 
-->It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. 
-->Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.
-->The two main categories of software are application software and system software. An application is software that fulfills a specific need or performs tasks. System software is designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of.

2)Types of Application
-->1)Word processors 2)Database programs 3)Web browsers 4)Deployment tools 5)Image editors 6)Communication platforms
-->Applications can vary in many ways, including how they're built, what platform they run on, whether they are open source or proprietary, or for which market they are used.
-->For example, a mobile application developer writes their code as a native, web or hybrid application -- and these terms can also describe desktop applications. The developer codes a native application to run on specific hardware, such as a camera or GPS, and in the same programming language as the underlying OS. For example, the Photos application on Mac OS X is written in Objective-C, which is the same language that Mac OS X uses.
-->An end user typically accesses a web application via a web browser, such as Google Chrome. A developer can write web applications in several languages, including JavaScript, CSS and HTML, but they cannot access the hardware on which the application is installed. 
-->Hybrid applications have APIs that can access device resources, similar to a native application, but are typically written in languages such as HTML and CSS. Additionally, developers often code mobile applications to work on a specific device platform.

3)What is Mobile Application
-->A mobile app (or mobile application) is a software application developed specifically for use on small, wireless computing devices, such as smartphones and tablets, rather than desktop or laptop computers.
-->Mobile apps are sometimes categorized according to whether they are web-based or native apps, which are created specifically for a given platform. A third category, hybrid apps, combines elements of both native and web apps.
-->In today's digital age, mobile apps are an essential part of most people's daily lives. From social networking and entertainment to productivity and business, mobile apps play a vital role in how we interact with technology.

4)Difference between mobile application and web application
-->Mobile applications are specifically created to be operated from mobile. In contrast, web applications are created with the purpose of the content and services being browsed by the user from any device via browsers.
-->Mobile applications need to be installed from the app store, while web applications can be easily viewed from any browser and thus do not need to be installed.
-->Mobile applications can be accessed even offline, and thatâ€™s not the case with web applications since browsers do not work without a proper internet connection.
-->Mobile applications are faster to browse, while web applications may take a while to load.
-->Mobile applications need to be approved by the app store. Since web applications are browsed through browsers, they need not require approval from the app store.
-->Mobile applications have more sophisticated security, while web applications may not have that level of heightened security compared to mobile applications.
-->Mobile apps need to be updated frequently. Web apps will take care of updates themselves.

5)Who developed Android 
-->Android is developed by Google(Andy Rubin,Rich Miner and Nick Sears)
